// BEGIN DESCRIPTION //

Testing files go here in the format:
```
<component>-<test>.c
```
DO NOT GENERALIZE MULTIPLE TESTS IN A SINGLE FILE!  
Split tests into very specific cases with one test case per file.
This should result in many test files, with many associated test-*
binaries, but will also improve the overall troubleshooting process.

// END DESCRIPTION //
